I'm Ben Cogan — a builder, reader, and writer living on the Upper West Side of New York.

I've co-founded several companies including [Hubble Contacts](https://hubblecontacts.com), [Mockingbird Strollers](https://hellomockingbird.com), and others. I currently serve as President of [Mangrove](https://sophrosyne.bio), a biotech company developing iPSC-derived neocortical tissue grafts. I also organize [Beanstalk](https://example.com), a conference for disruptor brands in retail.

I studied philosophy and political philosophy at Princeton. I'm on the board of [Giving What We Can](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/) and involved in the effective altruism community.

This site is where I write about whatever I'm thinking about — building companies, moral philosophy, personal finance, and whatever else catches my attention.

You can reach me at [hello@example.com](mailto:hello@example.com).
